# Icon Setup

For a complete add-on, you should add the following image files to this directory:

- `icon.png` - 256x256px icon for the add-on
- `logo.png` - Larger logo image (optional but recommended)

These will be displayed in the Home Assistant UI.

You can create custom icons or use the WaterFurnace branding (with appropriate permissions).

The icon files should be in PNG format with transparency.
